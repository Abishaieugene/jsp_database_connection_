Hello, Everyone!

I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully created a registration form and connected it to a database. 

This project took some time to build, but it was a great learning experience, especially in establishing JSP connectivity with a database.

When users fill out the fields in the form, their information is seamlessly processed in the backend via a servlet and securely stored in the database.

This project has provided me with valuable insights into database integration with JSP.

If you appreciate my work on this JSP database connectivity project, please give it a thumbs up!
